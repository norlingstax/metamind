"You seem like you don't understand that iPhone is the only phone coming with iOS. Maybe to you iOS is just another operating system and even it is similar to Android, they are far apart when we are talking about ecosystem which we are in this case. If you just need a phone and dont use other Apple products then buy Xiaomi, vivo, Oppo, Samsung or whatever of those zillion choices."
"If you could limit the 17 to 60Hz, like running only video playback, the vanilla 17 is a good as a 16+ while having a much smaller battery."
Yes. I did that mistake on my ip13 mini. Now I wonder if I can rollback need cable with Mac doing shenannnigjans who only apple controls
Ios26 explains why ip17 has worse battery than ip16. Try to do what compiz and vista did 20 years ago but even more baadly. Actually 1 hour less which is in 10-15% worse battery. Proven And proven again.
"It’s planned obsolescence and obsolete already new. And all that for $1000+. And people will buy that piece of s. like breads…. Hhard to understand."""
"Apple always does this to make iPhone users upgrade to newer iPhones. Performance and battery life always degrade over time with iPhones, sometimes in as little as two years."""
Apple gave this phone some long outstanding features and iFans are just going nuts. They're just features being trickled down from the Pro variants. This year's Pro variants have the updated design that'll probably be trickled down to this phone in 4 years' time.
Can someone please explain why the battery life of iPhone 16 better than iPhone 17 in battery test of GSMARENA even when the Apple is quoting a battery life improvement over previous generation?
"Apple lead the way..now everyone followed the trend after mocking Apple for years for no java, no headphone jack, no battery easy replacement back, no sd card and so on"""
"""Huh, still makes you think: if the price in Europe would be the same as in US, about 700 euros, would it be a game changer? Would the result be much higher sales? I guess sales are good as it is. Or would iPhone lose it's """"premium"""" image? But it's a premium phone in US, isn't it?"""
"""Worse battery life than iPhone 16, worse speaker volume than iphone 16, same ram, same main cam, same design but more expensive than iphone 16. silly."""
Ltt measured the brightness to be 3000 nits though and did not mention anything about it being back to 1000 nits after 2s. They just straight up said this display does go to 3000 nits.
"For the sake of sanity I went to check Mi15 Ultra pics to make sure I was thinking right on how a flagship camera should behave and guess what? Iphone pics are just garbage at this price range...this is ridiculous or, there's something wrong with GSMarena's unit."""
"I just look at multiple sources myself. Popular devices always have many people doing battery tests, so it's easy to find which ones are the outliers."""
"Doesn't seem to change the fact even the Chinese consumers prefer iPhones. At the flagship level, specs become irrelevant. Brand power is the key, and Chinese OEMs just couldn't figure it out because it's in their nature to only compete based on spec (trying to undercut the competitor, offering """"better"""" spec for the dollar). This is why the Chinese were successful in the low to mid end, beating the likes of HTC, Motorola (bought), Sony, etc. But Apple is not playing in that segment."
That guy in the comments claiming Chinese phones are a bastion of privacy is smoking some strong stuff. Indusputed fact remains that a Pixel flashed with GrapheneOS or an iPhone (preferably hardened by user or MDM) are the only acceptable options for any sort of privacy and security. Everything else will colonoscope you.
"It's apple, so its guaranteed to be something funky and weird that people wouldn't expect. Keep in mind that to this day, apple devices still support serial connections over USB for connecting to outdated ipod accessories"""
"I don't know if you have observed in the last few years that T series does not exist in China, while the next flagships come in the global market after more than 5 months. So, xiaomi is giving a lot of time to T series to depreciate."""
