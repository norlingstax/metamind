This is cheaper when you get it from Globe (one of the carriers in the Philippines). I got it with a free Galaxy Watch 6 44mm... Worth switching from iPhone! LOL

worse battery life then previous model.average at best cameras . worse performance in antutu then s24fe. garbage thermal performance ( what else is expected from exynos? ) . only samsung can pull this off.

Just underclocked 2400, because Samsung knew S24 FE would heat up with regular 2400. And that's why GPU and rest everything is exactly the same. Not like Apple who literally removes a GPU core

That is why the s25fe posted worse battery results and heating issues despite having a larger cooling chamber and a display that can dial down it's refresh rate to 1hz
I am wondering which fans want this crap Those whose phones are 5+ years old. If you have an S23FE, you don't even have to upgrade at all.

"At this point, I really hope FE didn't mean made of S25 series defect or refurbished parts... 2400e was a rejected 2400, probably with lower quality control. S25 FE got a slightly more reliable chip set. At least it doesn't have ""e"" letter in its name"
As it stands it's not cheaper enough compared to the fairly well known OnePlus 13, more obscure Nothing Phone 3 or even Samsung's own S25+ (which can easily be had 200 below retail to only just be more expensive than this) to justify the worse performance. It also doesn't have any redeeming qualities to show for it, like the Xcover's poor value is easier to accept with the easily removable battery, microSD card slot and 3.5mm port. It's one that is impossible to recommend for anyone until it goes on sale, but when it does it wouldn't be such a bad phone.

Just put 50-100  and get the OnePlus 13. This FE is total trash. It's a 450  AT BEST. The Nothing Phone 3a pro does a much better job.
This phone barely classifies as a high-midranger, but sure as hell charges almost flagship price. I guess the point is to make regular S series look like a bargain in comparison.

Where I'm from the biggest competition to the s25 Fe is the honor 400 pro which is almost double the price of the Fe in my country and older second hand flagships like the s24 to s24 ultra are all still quite over $900 so for me personally I'll get this FE as my main and continue enjoying my s24 Fe as my secondary
I have no idea at who this is aimed. S24+ is now cheaper bit with same chip and better camera, S24U costs about the same money now, with much better chip and wildly better cameras plus additional features
In my location, the X200 FE costs about an equivalent of 220 USD more than this S25 FE. Vivo doesn't have a realistic sense of their value.
"Please clarify the following 1: Display tech of Samsung S25 FE is it LTPO or not. 2: Is the frame material of Samsung S25 FE is ""2nd gen armor aluminum"" As the S25 & S25+ series."

Here in the Balkans and Italy, there is a sale that if you buy a Samsung Galaxy S25 series or Z 2025 series, you can get the S25FE for free. I think its a deal many people are considering. I haven't seen these since 2019 with the Galaxy S10 series
Who is ariana ?? Ariana as in Ariana Grande? Sweetener is one of her albums and the ones in Sweetener's profile picture are Ariana Grande and Mariah Carey.
11 hours better call that is no joke. This is the difference between snapdragon and exynos. Actually, S24 FE with exynos 2400e had 37hrs call time, 13hrs more than S25 FE. So it's not due to Exynos
"So you go in store and have a look at the devices. You see this S25 fe all new and shiny. The seller will approach and ""assist"" you in buying it. You buy it, all happy and sound. Then you wanna go somewhere and have a few videos and handful of snaps. It's a brand-new Samsung device after all... But sadly, it will drain its battery quickly and will be hot to hold. And then you are like... ""It's 2025, and still phones are coming out with severe overheating issues and battery drain"". Then you go back, return it and choose something well better for less money (plenty of options)."
junk it is. looks all 'new' phones manufactor made lausier than older one,only new is price,and its higher....lets vote keep them storage. waiting Realme 8 GT and GT pro....might next one,or Oppo.,..bcoz i feel very strong that samsung 26 ultra is going same way.
Prices on this will drop like flies...you can already get it from Spain for  500 lol Samsung knows pretty well, this launch price is extremely overpriced!
LTPO is variable refresh rate, but variable refresh rate is not always LTPO I mean the screen is 1Hz static. So it must have LTPO.
And still they give it 4.2. Obvious shill is an obvious shill. They know many people will just look at the score, so they get paid to give a good score, what they write is probably not too strictly restricted.
Yeah it's an LTPO. Funny how they advertised 200mah more battery, but not LTPO LTPO is variable refresh rate, but variable refresh rate is not always LTPO
I am of the opinion that samsung is going to discontinue it's FE series of galaxy phones ... more It's the opposite, since there won't be a Plus model for the S26 series, Samsung will give more attention to FE series starting with S26 FE. We will possibly see 12GB of RAM, ultrasonic fingerprint scanner, Exynos 2500 or the upcoming Exynos 2600 chipset and a new telephoto camera possibly the same one used on S25 Plus.
I am of the opinion that samsung is going to discontinue it's FE series of galaxy phones - with consecutive half-hearted attempts at making a good FE device. Each successive FE device is becoming unappealing.
Looks clear that all big phone politics is make new version they phones but only new i see is name. New versions loose all categiries! I think its telling sonething what they thing customers.... buying samsung 25 FE...NEVER. Well lets 17 pro max review...

[deleted post] I just tested it against my s23. Playing a video my s23 goes to 24fps. This s25fe only goes down to 60fps. According to gsmarena it apparently supports a wide range of refresh rates???
The phone has basic AOD. You can't completely resize the clock and date because it's not LTPO.... more The fact that it can dial all the way down to 1hz means it is ltpo
Bigger battery, Ltpo screen yet it put lower scores from last year S24Fe.... Also, lower peak brightness and same performance overall.. This is also the most expensive phone in the world to ship with 8/128. This isnt worth more than 3.9-4 stars.
But then here they say it dials down to 1hz sometimes. Something only LTPO displays can do... The phone has basic AOD. You can't completely resize the clock and date because it's not LTPO. It's LTPS same as on the S24 FE.

"It depends on the region he obviously doesn't live in your region Looking at his comment, he 99% lives in my region. It's pretty obvious. Only in India, Reno 14 and Vivo V60 launched at similiar time at exactly same price (37,999 inr). And he's referring to S24 FE, which is currently discounted to around 38k inr as well. That's why he told ""exactly same cost"". Typical coping, he just knowingly says s25 fe costs same as them to justify his preference. While S25 FE has launched at >$800.

Can someone say if it's LTPO or not? Official Samsung website says non-LTPO, but here GSMARENA is saying it's LTPO in testing. Also, why is S25 FE call times suddenly so low compared to S24 FE (37hrs vs 24hrs)

This thing would have made so much more sense as an A-series phone instead of a S-series. I mean, they made a $800 phone with performance of a $500-600 device and battery of yesteryear. Though, Samsung phones do have the tendency to be on sale after a rather short period of time, and it would have made so much more sense to buy it then rather than now. Or maybe just don't buy it at all and get a S25 (which is a proper flagship), or A56 (much cheaper, basically the same experience, just not as much performance).
Only a fanatic would buy this phone. Oh wait nevermind. It depends on the market. Here, S25 FE, Vivo V60 and Oppo Reno14 costs exactly the same. I would rather buy S25 FE rather than Vivo V60 or Oppo Reno14.
Is this the smallest camera sensor ever (8 MP, 1 mm pixel pitch, 8 mmÂ² area)? Even the very first Galaxy S GT-I9000 from 2010 featured a 50% larger sensor (12 mmÂ² area). In fact, the sensor is so small that the iPhone 16 Pro's 24 mm camera rivals the physical focal length of the S25 FE's 75 mm camera which is ludicrous.
Samsung disappoints again. I remember a time when all Samsung would do is produce the best phones money could buy. 10 years ago no other phone could come close. How time flies.
I can even get the S25+ for the same amount or lower so it's rubbish I can even get S24 ultra for the same price or lower too bruv   
As a former Galaxy owner my question is: Why would I buy this for 750  if the normal Samsung Galaxy S25 is on the market for 568  and the S25 Plus for 728 ? What is the point of the FE at this point? There's also the Chinese competition. And the iPhone 17 that if finally a good phone with a proper HRR screen and 256GB base storage. But I believe the iPhone in Europe is around 1k and not the 799$ it is in the US...
Way more expensive than the S24 Plus (at least in my country) while having less RAM and lacking some features. Samsung launch prices never makes Sense.
